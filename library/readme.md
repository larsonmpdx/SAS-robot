this is the shared library file for both robot and controller
it describes the communication packet used and implements a debug printing function
it needs to be placed in the arduino IDE's `/libraries/` folder in order to be used
on windows this is normally in `/Documents/Arduino/libraries/`
it is customary to put it inside its own folder, for example:
`/Documents/Arduino/libraries/robot/packets.h / packets.cpp`
